# 🤖 AI Resume Checker – Telegram Conversational Bot

A chat-first automation that reviews resumes through a conversation instead of a dashboard.

Users simply message a Telegram bot, paste a Google Docs resume link, and instantly receive an AI evaluation — optionally delivered to their email as a formatted report.

No uploads. No forms. Just a conversation.

## ✨ Concept

Traditional resume tools = **Upload → Wait → Download**

This project = **Talk → Understand → Analyze → Improve**

The system behaves like a virtual career mentor that guides the user, interprets intent, fetches the resume, evaluates it, and delivers feedback automatically.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User opens Telegram chat
2. Bot detects user intent
3. User shares Google Docs resume
4. Resume content is extracted
5. AI evaluates structure & employability signals
6. Report sent in chat
7. Optional email delivery

Software should not feel like software.

This project turns a static document into an interactive mentoring experience — a resume becomes a conversation instead of a file.
